## ‚≠êÔ∏è What did I learn

This is the most comprehensive project that I have built. I learned a lot about working with API and how the frontend is connected to the backend. By using Redux I discovered how to manage the global state in the application, while working with bigger project I learned that folder structure is important.

## ü§ñ Why Strong Coders?

Strong Coders gives you **tools** to share your workouts with **other people**. It's easier to stay motivated when you surround yourself with people that have the same goal as you. Programmers are often too busy to work out which can defect their health - I hope with my app they will get their workouts done!
